The Domesday Duplicator (DdD) is a open-source, open-hardware USB 3.0 solution designed and built for capturing LaserDiscs RF for the ld-decode project.

The Domesday Duplicator is a 40 Million Samples Per Second sampler with 10-bit accuracy.

> [!CAUTION]
> - The DdD is also suitable for use capturing many other single channel FM RF based formats, such as Video8/Hi8 & Betamax NTSC.
>
> - However VHS, Betamax PAL and other formats may require multiple ADC channels for Video RF & HiFi audio (Also Baseband or Linear audio) please look at the [Clockgen Mod](https://github.com/oyvindln/vhs-decode/wiki/Clockgen-Mod) and the [MISRC](https://github.com/Stefan-Olt/MISRC/).
