# ld-decode Documentation

This is the ld-decode documentation repository containing the source for the project's GitHub Pages documentation site (formerly known as the 'wiki').

This documentation repository contains the source Markdown files that make up the documentation.  The Markdown is automatically converted into a full HTML website using Jekyll combined with GitHub actions.

You do NOT need to understand HTML to contribute - all contributions are welcome in Markdown (just like the original project wiki).  See the Contributing section below.
